
Snake 7
We described the pieces of the snake, now let's take care of the snake itself.
The snake should have a list of pieces (SnakeSection) and a head.
Let the head be just the first piece itself (with number 0).
The snake also has a direction of movement - the side where it moves by default.
And there is a condition - the snake is alive or dead.
The game ends when the snake is dead.
It is necessary:
A) Add a sections field of type List <SnakeSection> to the Snake class
B) Add an isAlive field of type boolean.
C) Add a direction field of type SnakeDirection.
D) for all fields add getter, and for direction also a setter.
Note:
For fields of a logical type, getters are usually written not as getValue (), but
as isValue () - this improves the readability of the code.
